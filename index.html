  <p>Hello my name is Haylee Bell and this is my page. I am first and foremost a nerd and geek.
  I love everything from computers to math to comics to science fiction and everything in between.
  I wish I could say something super dazzling here that captured your attention and/or made you 
  laugh. However, I am socially awkward and that shows up in my writing as well apparently.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
  <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Criminology from California State University San Marcos. That is 
  how I ended up at my current job as a Police Dispatcher for the San Diego Police Department. While
  I love my job I know it is not the final career path for me. I have a great love for computers and 
  want to learn as much as I can about how they work and how to make them work. I am currently taking
  the UCSD coding bootcamp to help give me the tools to change career paths.More about who I am as a
  person. I am difficult and strong willed. I am stubborn and love a good challenge. Learning every 
  day is one of my main goals in life. Being a student and working is a good way to achieve that 
  goal. And hopefully after this course I will be a web designer.</p>
